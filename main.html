	 	Eunice Claudine (Chloe) Cruz. First of all, I was greatful. That I had to meet a great person like you. I learned so much from you. The way you always think about the positive things in life. The way you dream of the things you want to do or go. How did it happen? How did I fell for you. You're not even doing anything remotely related to the things I love. But It did happen. I fell for you. All the things you do, I find cute. The way you smile. The way you laugh. The sound of your voice. Well, voices. The baby voice. The work voice. The "malaking" boses lol. Love 'em all. Why are you so fucking perfect to me. The way you are so passionate about everything you do and tell. The way you tell me your stories. And while you were telling these stories, I'm taking notes. I want to.  To condition myself when "we" happen. Maybe that's why I didn't give up the first time? Because I know I could give you all you want and umaasa padin akong mabibigyan mo 'ko ng chance. Na dahil broken ka pa now, baka kapag naging okay ka na, ready kana magbigay ng chance sa ating dalwa.

	 	I swear, we're perfect for each other. Well you are to me. And I can try, to be that for you too. I can be. I know I can. Alam ko 'yung mga past mo. Alam ko kung pa'no ka nasaktan. Alam ko ang mga dapat kong gawin. Alam ko ang mga hindi ko dapat gawin. Dami kong napapanaginipan. Mga supposed travels nating dalawa. Like when you have a shoot with Adi, sasamahan kita. 'Di kita pagbabawalan sa mga ganon. Yayakagin ko pa sila magdinner with us. Kasi alam ko it makes you feel confident with your body. Or mga planned travel ko with you. Like sa Tagaytay. Sa Sunflower Field. Or sa Ocean Park. Or sa Korea / Japan travel na ika'y naka-suot ng traditional Korean / Japanese clothes. Or sa Wizarding World, na parehas tayong naka Hogwarts Robe with our corresponding house. You being a Slytherin and me being a Ravenclaw. Or sa mga DIY stores, looking at you being excited at being maingay sa store kapag nakakakita ka ng mga magagandang items to add into your shop. It brings me joy. It brings me happiness to see you smile. Gusto ko din makita ka sa personal habang gumagawa ng packages for your shop. You looking so tired, but being passionate at the same time then I'll bring you your food and drinks. I also know you're acidic. So I took notes kung ano 'yung mga bawal sa'yo. Or kapag may sakit ka, lulutuan kita (mag-aaral ako syempre) ng Sinigang na hipon kasi fave mo 'yun. Or magbi-build ako ng malakasan na PC para kapag rest day mo, dito ka mag-stream sa bahay. Then sabihin mo sa stream is "Change Background muna, dito me sa bahay ng boyfriend ko". 

	 	Tell me, why can't you just choose me? Why can't you just love me? I promise that you won't regret it. Lagi kong ibaba pride ko for you. Ikaw lang lagi ang pipiliin. Kasi ikaw lang naman lagi ang nasa choice. Ikaw lang. Lahat titiisin para sa'yo. Magsisinungaling lang kapag isusurpise ka. Maybe that's it? Maybe because I'm such a hopeless romantic. Well who wouldn't be for you. I'll be that sweet, geeky, cringe guy for you. I'll show you how much I love you.

	 	Maybe the reason I fell for you, besides the things listed above, is that besides our differences in the things we like, we show our "love" the same. We put effort. We take notes of the things the significant other likes or dislikes. Maybe you're the girl I've been dreaming for. Maybe you could be "THE ONE" for me. The things we would do for each other. The "love" we could have had. You're like a treasure box. I learn random things about you over time only to discover that you're more beautiful than I already thought you were.

	 	But, our stars won't align. Maybe it's for the best? or worse? Dunno. I wanted to move on, but I can't. Deep inside I'm still hoping na kaya ayaw mo is not because you don't want us to happen. Na maybe ayaw mo kasi ayaw mo ma-judge? Or maybe sobrang takot ka sa commitment now because of your past experiences. Na nag-ooverthink ka na "baka 'pag naging kami tapos bigla s'yang mawala sa buhay ko kasi tanga ako magdecide". I dunno.
